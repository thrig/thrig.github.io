<h1>Title</h1>

<p>A title, a dictionary informs me, may among other things be &quot;the name of
a book, composition, or other artistic work&quot;. Dictionaries were invented
to stop or at least slow down the evolution of words; the prior
definition may be outdated, or with any luck archaic before not too
long. With this in mind we may proceede to analyse the title of this
site, which is the &quot;Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Thrigistan&quot;. I think
I&#39;ve managed to pack a goodly number of lies into that; for one, this is
not a Democracy. Second, it does not belong to the Peoples, whomever
they may be. One could argue that multiple people are necessary to
operate and contentify and consume the Internet; whether the resulting
artifact is the People&#39;s is another question. Republic is also wrong. I
am informed that there is no Thrigistan. Etc.</p>

<p>Words of course are rather strange things. Take ASCII, codified as 128
numbers of various use that in under 50 years has already been modified
to mean any sort of text whatever even if few (or none) of the
characters involved belong to ASCII. Hence <code>not-ascii</code> (and <code>ntr</code> or
numeric <code>tr</code>) over in some scripts repository. Or the MOV of assembly,
which actually performs a copy. This could be the &quot;make progress&quot; flavor
of move, not the &quot;change position&quot; definition, so I&#39;ve made peace with
that term. Somewhat. Continuous integration is another bad one; how is
it continuous if it happens only upon some hook firing? Vendoring, where
nothing is being sold, but copies are apparently moved hither and yon.</p>

<p>Here is some copy, moved as such.</p>
